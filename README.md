# Homeless Shelter

### What is Homeless Shelter

This is an Android App that allows homeless people to check-in to bed spaces at shelters nearby. Shelter Employees(Volunteers) are able to post their empty bed spaces for shelter seekers to use. Administrators are able to lock and unlock accounts when suspicious activities are detected.

### Note

The newest working version is in the "nancy-google" branch instead of "Master".
Use Nexus 5 API 24 as a working emulator.
