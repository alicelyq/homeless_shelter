# Homeless Shelter

### What is Homeless Shelter

This is an Android App that allows homeless people to checkin to bedspaces at shelters nearby. Shelter Employees(Volunteers) are able to post their empty bedspaces for shelter seekers to use. Administators are able to lock and unlock accounts when suspicious activities are detected.

### Note

The newest working version is in the "nancy-google" branch instead of "Master".
